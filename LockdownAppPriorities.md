## Lockdown App priorities ##
Here is a breakdown of the five important features:

1: Report an emergency:  Staff notify the on site administrators of a potential threat.  Administrators will be assigned by location

2:  Emergency Procedures:  Area to cut and paste specific emergency procedures

3:  Report a medical Emergency:  This area would notify Administration and command center of a specific medical emergency in your area

4:  Notification icon / Message board:  area for real time updates from Admin to staff

5:  Area showing type of emergency.  Remains on screen

Some of the other things that would be nice,  When an emergency gets posted,  a notification sound would alert the user and once acknowledged, silence the phone.
