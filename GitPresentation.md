## Useful Git Links ##

This document is a supplement to a discussion I will be having at Central Connecticut State University in the CS Club, regarding Version Control Systems, namely Git. I do not own the following links, I have just curated a few useful links to share with my fellow students:

- [Simple Git for Windows Setup Guide!](https://gist.github.com/dmangiarelli/1a0ae107aaa5c478c51e) This was created by a friend of mine, as a supplement to another presentation I contributed to.

- Useful [Cheat Sheet](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/) 
- [Github for Students](https://education.github.com/) Because you can get a free account with 5 private repositories.
